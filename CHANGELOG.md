# Changelog

All notable changes to this pipeline are documented here, newest first.
**Every behavior-changing commit must carry its entry in the same commit** —
see `CLAUDE.md` (the sync contract).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- `python-docx` dropped from `requirements-dev.txt`. It was a test dependency of
  the distill/segmentation/emitter suites, all deleted in `79b0b5b`; no test path
  imports `docx` any more. Verified by `grep -rn docx --include="*.py" .` returning
  nothing outside the requirements file itself. `pytest -q` → `87 passed in 0.70s`.

- **Backfill for `79b0b5b`** (which shipped without its entry): DOCX intake, the
  emitter, and emitter-bound gates removed. `pipeline/intake/` (16 files),
  `pipeline/generate/` (11), `distiller/` (4, with `anti-slop-prose.md` and
  `serp-title-meta-craft.md` ported to `skills/site-remediation/references/` first).
  Gates 19 → 16: `pages_are_data_check`, `brief_fanout_check`, and
  `validate_multistate_config` deleted. Also removed `cycle_status.py`,
  `lib/cycle_state.py`, `gbp_baseline.py`, `setup_gtm_foundation.py`, the
  `intake-poll` / `drive-poll` / `cycle-emit` workflows, and 15 test files.
  133 files → 73, 354 tests → 87. See `SITE-AUDIT-PIPELINE.md` §3.

## [0.1.0] — template extraction

- Initial template: extracted from a production multi-client pipeline with all
  client data, credentials, IDs, and brand references replaced by placeholders.
  Engineering content (modules, 19 gates, workflows, tests, encoded lessons)
  preserved intact; full test suite green at extraction time.
